Overview
--------

This package is intended to be used with Bok Choy's `interface to aXe Core accessibility auditing library <http://bok-choy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api_reference.html#module-bok_choy.a11y.axe_core_ruleset>`_.

``lib/custom_a11y_ruleset.js`` contains some custom edX accessibility rules, written to be compatible with aXe core.

Please review the  `Bok Choy documentation <http://bok-choy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api_reference.html#module-bok_choy.a11y.axe_core_ruleset>`_ for details about how to include custom rules
in a page audit.


Installation
------------

Install from github with:

.. code:: bash

    npm install edx/edx-custom-a11y-rules#v0.1.0



Writing new rules
-----------------

Getting set up for development
==============================

Make sure npm is installed, then:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/openedx/edx-custom-a11y-rules.git
    cd edx-custom-a11y-rules
    make develop


Development guides
==================

New Rules and Checks should be written in ``lib/custom_a11y_rules.js``.

* `aXe Core development guide for Rules <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/developer-guide.md#rules>`_

* `aXe Core development guide for Checks <https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/developer-guide.md#checks>`_


Testing guide
=============

There are Jasmine tests for checking that the custom rules
behave as intended and that they can integrate with aXe Core.
These can be run in "dev" mode, which keeps the browser up
for debugging, or in "single-run" mode to run once and exit.
See the `Testing checklist`_ below for more details about writing
tests.

To run tests for the custom ruleset in "dev" mode:

.. code:: bash

    make test-dev


To run tests for the custom ruleset in "single-run" mode:

.. code:: bash

    make test


Additionally, to check code quality with JSHint, use:

.. code:: bash

    make quality


Testing checklist
*****************

* Write sample html files with the examples of pass/fail cases in ``test/fixtures/``.  These are the fixtures that will be used for tests.

* If you are writing a Check, add the test cases for your check to ``specCases`` in ``test/spec/checks_spec.js``.

* If you are writing a Rule, add the test cases for your rule to ``specCases`` in ``test/spec/rule_spec.js``.

* If needed, any new integration tests can go in ``test/spec/integration_spec.js``.


Publishing a New Version
========================

When you have merged changes via a reviewed PR, update the version number in ``package.json``,
and publish the new version to npm using ``npm publish``.

If you need NPM permissions to publish a new version, send a request to ``front-end-dev@edx.org``.
